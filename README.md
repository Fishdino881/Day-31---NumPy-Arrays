# Day-31 NumPy-Arrays

Overview

On Day 31, I started working with NumPy, a core Python library for numerical computing. NumPy arrays are faster, more efficient, and more powerful than Python lists, especially for mathematical and data operations.


Topics Covered

1. Creating NumPy Arrays

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)


2. Array Properties

print(arr.shape)
print(arr.size)
print(arr.dtype)

shape → dimensions of the array
size → total number of elements
dtype → data type


3. Multi-dimensional Arrays

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])



4. Array Operations

arr + 2
arr * 3

NumPy allows element-wise operations without loops.

Learning Outcome
Understood difference between lists and NumPy arrays
Learned array creation and properties
Practiced basic numerical operations using NumPy
